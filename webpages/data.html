    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <p>At the dawn of agriculture, about 8000 B.C., the population of the world was approximately 5 million. Over the 8,000-year period up to 1 A.D. it grew to 200 million (some estimate 300 million or even 600, suggesting how imprecise population estimates of early historical periods can be), with a growth rate of under 0.05% per year.</p>
    <p>A tremendous change occurred with the industrial revolution: whereas it had taken all of human history until around 1800 for world population to reach one billion, the second billion was achieved in only 130 years (1930), the third billion in 30 years (1960), the fourth billion in 15 years (1974), and the fifth billion in only 13 years (1987).</p>
    <ul class="table1">
      <li><p>During the 20th century alone, the population in the world has grown from 1.65 billion to 6 billion.</p></li>
      <li><p>In 1970, there were roughly half as many people in the world as there are now.</p></li>
      <li><p>Because of declining growth rates, it will now take over 200 years to double again.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Growth Rate</h1>
    <img src="..\img\graph2.png" alt="graph2" class="graph2">
    <p>Population in the world is growing at a rate of around 0.88% per year in 2023 (down from 0.98% in 2020, and 1.06% in 2019). The current population increase is estimated at around 70 million people per year.</p>
    <p>Annual growth rate reached its peak in the late 1960s, when it was at around 2%. The rate of increase has nearly halved since then, and will continue to decline in the coming years.</p>
    <p>World population will therefore continue to grow in the 21st century, but at a much slower rate compared to the recent past. World population has doubled (100% increase) in 40 years from 1959 (3 billion) to 1999 (6 billion). It is now estimated that it will increase by 50% in the subsequent 40 years, to reach 9 billion by 2037.</p>
    <p>The latest world population projections indicate that world population will reach 10 billion persons in the year 2057 and 10.4 billion in 2100.</p>

    <h1>World Population by Religion</h1>
    <p>According to a recent study (based on the 2010 world population of 6.9 billion) by The Pew Forum, there are:</p>
    <ul class="table2">
      <li><b>2,173,180,000 Christians (31%</b> of world population), of which 50% are Catholic, 37% Protestant, 12% Orthodox, and 1% other.</li>
      <li><b>1,598,510,000 Muslims (23%)</b>, of which 87-90% are Sunnis, 10-13% Shia.</li>
      <li><b>1,126,500,000 No Religion affiliation (16%):</b> atheists, agnostics and people who do not identify with any particular religion. One-in-five people (20%) in the United States are religiously unaffiliated.</li>
      <li><b>1,033,080,000 Hindus (15%)</b>, the overwhelming majority (94%) of which live in India.</li>
      <li><b>487,540,000 Buddhists (7%)</b>, of which half live in China.</li>
      <li><b>405,120,000 Folk Religionists (6%)</b>: faiths that are closely associated with a particular group of people, ethnicity or tribe.</li>
      <li><b>58,110,000 Other Religions (1%)</b>: Bahaâ€™i faith, Taoism, Jainism, Shintoism, Sikhism, Tenrikyo, Wicca, Zoroastrianism and many others.</li>
      <li><b>13,850,000 Jews (0.2%)</b>, four-fifths of which live in two countries: United States (41%) and Israel (41%).</li>
